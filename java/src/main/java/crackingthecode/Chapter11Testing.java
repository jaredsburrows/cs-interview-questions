    // - - does not scrape paper when writing
    // ink shaft
    // - test if there is ink left by writing
    // - test if turned upside down, does the ink come out?
    // - try shaking/getting the pen to explode
    // button
    // - push button once - tip should come out
    // - push button once again - tip should go back
    // - hold and release push button - tip should come out
    // - hold and release push button - tip should go back in
    // clip
    // - test clip by hanging on clothes or adding to pen holder

    // ask interview for specifics
    // ink wash off? water? temperature?
    // ink ash off clothing?
    // is the pen's ink safe for children?

    // Use ATM to withdraw money
    // - normal transaction - should get status
    // - attempt wrong pin - should get status
    // - try to overdraw - should get status
    // - withdraw equal to account balance
    // - multiple transactions at the same time? - would have to be automated, can't be in two places at once
    // Connection
    // - test unplugging while in use - should keep cache and dump log
    // - test unplugging internet cable - should reestablish connection
