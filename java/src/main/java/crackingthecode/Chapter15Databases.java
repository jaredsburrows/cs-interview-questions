    // Improve database performance
    // Pros
    // - Improved performance
    // - Need fewer joins
    // - Maintain history information
    // Cons
    // - Problems with data consistency - mainly with aggregated data, needs updates

    // In computing, denormalization is the process of attempting to optimize the read performance
    // of a database by adding redundant data or by grouping data.[1][2] In some cases,
    // denormalization is a means of addressing performance or scalability in relational
    // database software.

    // A normalized design will often store different but related pieces of information in separate
    // logical tables (called relations). If these relations are stored physically as separate disk
    // files, completing a database query that draws information from several relations
    // (a join operation) can be slow. If many relations are joined, it may be prohibitively slow.
    // There are two strategies for dealing with  The preferred method is to keep the logical
    // design normalized, but allow the database management system (DBMS) to store additional
    // redundant information on disk to optimise query response. In this case it is the DBMS
    // software's responsibility to ensure that any redundant copies are kept consistent. This
    // method is often implemented in SQL as indexed views (Microsoft SQL Server) or materialised
    // views (Oracle, PostgreSQL). A view represents information in a format convenient for
    // querying, and the index ensures that queries against the view are optimised.

    // The more usual approach is to denormalize the logical data design. With care this can achieve
    // a similar improvement in query response, but at a cost—it is now the database designer's
    // responsibility to ensure that the denormalized database does not become inconsistent. This is
    // done by creating rules in the database called constraints, that specify how the redundant
    // copies of information must be kept synchronised. It is the increase in logical complexity of
    // the database design and the added complexity of the additional constraints that make this
    // approach hazardous. Moreover, constraints introduce a trade-off, speeding up reads
    // (SELECT in SQL) while slowing down writes (INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE). This means a
    // denormalized database under heavy write load may actually offer worse performance than its
    // functionally equivalent normalized counterpart.
